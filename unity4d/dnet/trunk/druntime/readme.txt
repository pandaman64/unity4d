The source code repository for Druntime is: http://dsource.org/projects/druntime

Druntime is the minimum library required to support the D programming
language. It includes the system code required to support the garbage collector,
associative arrays, exception handling, array vector operations,
startup/shutdown, etc.

Druntime forms a common layer underlying the Phobos and Tango user libraries.
